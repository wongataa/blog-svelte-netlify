title: One More Down
---
Days go by like beans being endlessly counted. There's no end in sight and they blur together.

But make it easier on yourself. Take care of your human essentials. Sleep, eat, connect and find a way outside. Find a way to laugh. Make a moment of magic. Do that and whatever else you have on will go better.
